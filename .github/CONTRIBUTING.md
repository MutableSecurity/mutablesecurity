# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project ðŸŽŠ!

The old content of this document was removed because it was out of date after the most recent refactoring. We intend to create separate documentation in the coming weeks to assist both users (administrators who use MutableSecurity to manage their cybersecurity solutions) and contributors (fellow Pythonistas who want to contribute to the project's progress).
